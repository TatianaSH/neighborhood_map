Open http://tatianash.github.io/neighborhood_map in a web browser.
The Places Search in Gaithersburg is an application that shows points of interest around Gaithersburg, MD.
You can:
* Search for local businesses by name or type (like 'ice cream').
* Click a current map marker to get more info about a business (name, address).
* Browse search results from a list view. Click the location to see its marker and info on the map.
I use Yelp API for addition information.
I use CSS media queries for support screens less then 480px, 480-768 and above.
